# Connect4dots
 Connect the dots (also known as connect-the-dots, dot to dot, or join the dots) is a form of puzzle containing a sequence of numbered dots. When a line is drawn connecting the dots the outline of an object is revealed. The puzzles frequently contain simple line art to enhance the image created or to assist in rendering a complex section of the image.
This project aims to solve the stalemate problem that occurs in the traditional game by connecting the dots diagonally.
